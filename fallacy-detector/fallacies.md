## Formal Fallacies

Formal fallacies have invalid logical structure where the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises regardless of content.

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Affirming the Consequent** | Assumes that if P→Q and Q is true, then P must be true | "If it rains, the ground is wet. The ground is wet, so it rained." (Sprinklers exist) |
| **Denying the Antecedent** | Assumes that if P→Q and P is false, then Q must be false | "If you study, you'll pass. You didn't study, so you won't pass." (Natural aptitude exists) |
| **Undistributed Middle** | Syllogism where the middle term doesn't cover all members | "All dogs are mammals. All cats are mammals. Therefore, all dogs are cats." |
| **Illicit Major/Minor** | Syllogism where a term is distributed in conclusion but not premise | "All cats are animals. No dogs are cats. Therefore, no dogs are animals." |
| **Four-Term Fallacy** | Syllogism uses a term with two different meanings | "Nothing is better than eternal happiness. A ham sandwich is better than nothing. Therefore, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness." |
| **Existential Fallacy** | Assumes existence from universal statements | "All unicorns are magical. Therefore, some magical things exist." |

## Informal Fallacies — Relevance

These fallacies introduce irrelevant considerations or attack the wrong target.

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Ad Hominem** | Attacks the person making the argument rather than the argument itself | "You can't trust his climate research because he drives an SUV." |
| **Tu Quoque** | Dismisses an argument because the arguer doesn't follow their own advice | "You say smoking is bad, but you smoke yourself." |
| **Appeal to Authority** | Uses authority outside their expertise or as sole evidence | "This physicist says vaccines are dangerous, so they must be." |
| **Appeal to Popularity** | Argues something is true or good because many people believe or do it | "Millions of people use this supplement, so it must work." |
| **Appeal to Tradition** | Argues something is correct because it's the way things have been done | "We've always done it this way, so it must be the right approach." |
| **Appeal to Nature** | Argues something is good or right because it's natural | "Herbal remedies are better because they're natural." |
| **Appeal to Emotion** | Substitutes emotional manipulation for logical argument | Responding to "We should reform pensions for sustainability" with "How can you support this when my grandmother would lose her benefits?" |
| **Appeal to Fear** | Uses fear to persuade rather than evidence | "If we don't act now, civilisation will collapse." (without supporting evidence) |
| **Appeal to Pity** | Uses sympathy to persuade rather than evidence | "You should pass me — I worked so hard on this paper." |
| **Appeal to Consequences** | Argues truth based on desirable or undesirable outcomes | "Climate change can't be real because the economic impact would be devastating." |
| **Genetic Fallacy** | Judges something based on its origin rather than its current merit | "That idea came from a Reddit thread, so it can't be valid." |
| **Poisoning the Well** | Preemptively discredits a source before they speak | "Before he responds, remember he's funded by the industry." |
| **Red Herring** | Introduces an irrelevant topic to divert attention from the argument | "Why discuss my expenses when there are homeless people suffering?" |
| **Straw Man** | Misrepresents an argument to make it easier to attack | "You want gun control? So you want to leave everyone completely defenceless?" |
| **Tone Policing** | Dismisses an argument based on how it's delivered rather than its content | "I can't take your point seriously when you're being so emotional." |

## Informal Fallacies — Presumption

These fallacies make unwarranted assumptions or presuppose what they're trying to prove.

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Begging the Question** | Assumes the conclusion in the premise | "The Bible is true because it's the word of God, and we know it's God's word because the Bible says so." |
| **Circular Reasoning** | The conclusion is used as a premise | "I'm trustworthy because I say I am." |
| **False Dilemma** | Presents only two options when more exist | "You're either with us or against us." |
| **False Equivalence** | Treats two things as equal when they differ significantly | "Both sides are equally bad" (when evidence heavily favours one side) |
| **Loaded Question** | A question that presupposes something unproven | "Have you stopped cheating on your taxes?" |
| **Complex Question** | Bundles multiple claims into one question, forcing acceptance of both | "Do you support our troops and the war?" — Answering "yes" or "no" traps you into a position on both. |
| **No True Scotsman** | Redefines a group to exclude counterexamples | "No real scientist would question this." (excluding scientists who do question it) |
| **Moving the Goalposts** | Changes the criteria for proof after they've been met | "Show me evidence." *shows evidence* "That's not the right kind of evidence." |
| **Special Pleading** | Applies standards to others but exempts oneself without justification | "Journalists should disclose conflicts of interest, but my situation is different." |
| **Cherry Picking** | Selects only evidence that supports the conclusion while ignoring contradicting evidence | Citing one favourable study while ignoring ten that contradict it |
| **Survivorship Bias** | Focuses on successes while ignoring failures | "Dropouts like Gates and Zuckerberg succeeded, so college is unnecessary." |
| **Texas Sharpshooter** | Draws conclusions from random clusters of data | Finding patterns in random data after the fact and claiming they're meaningful |
| Motte and Bailey | Defends a bold claim (bailey) by retreating to an obvious one (motte) when challenged, then acts as if the bold claim was defended | Claims "capitalism is evil" (bailey), when challenged retreats to "capitalism has flaws" (motte), then continues arguing as if "evil" was proven |

## Informal Fallacies — Ambiguity

These fallacies exploit unclear language, shifting meanings, or structural confusion.

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Equivocation** | Uses a word with different meanings in the same argument | "The sign said 'fine for parking here.' Since it's fine, I parked." |
| **Amphiboly** | Grammatical ambiguity allows a statement to be interpreted multiple ways | Oracle tells king: "If you attack, a great empire will fall" — King assumes enemy's empire; his own falls instead |
| **Accent** | Emphasis on different words changes meaning | "I didn't say he STOLE the money" (implying someone else did) |
| **Composition** | Assumes what's true of parts is true of the whole | "Every player on the team is excellent, so the team must be excellent." |
| **Division** | Assumes what's true of the whole is true of its parts | "The company is profitable, so every division must be profitable." |
| **Reification** | Treats abstract concepts as concrete things | "Science says..." (science doesn't speak; scientists with varying views do) |

## Informal Fallacies — Causation

These fallacies misattribute causes, confuse correlation with causation, or make unjustified causal leaps.

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** | Assumes causation from temporal sequence | "I wore my lucky socks and we won, so the socks caused the win." |
| **Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** | Assumes causation from correlation | "Ice cream sales and drownings correlate, so ice cream causes drowning." (Both caused by summer heat) |
| **Regression Fallacy** | Attributes natural statistical regression to a specific cause | "I took vitamins when I was sickest and got better" (would have regressed to mean anyway) |
| **Single Cause** | Oversimplifies a complex phenomenon to one cause when multiple exist | "Crime increased because of video games." |
| **Wrong Direction** | Reverses the actual cause and effect | "Successful people wake up early, so waking up early causes success." |
| **Slippery Slope** | Assumes a chain of events will follow without justification | "If we allow X, then Y will happen, then Z, and then total societal collapse." |
| **Gambler's Fallacy** | Believes past random events affect future probabilities | "I've lost five coin flips in a row, so I'm due for a win." |

## Informal Fallacies — Induction

These fallacies involve flawed generalisation, improper use of evidence, or faulty probabilistic reasoning.

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Hasty Generalisation** | Draws a broad conclusion from too few examples | "I met two rude French people, so French people are rude." |
| **Anecdotal Evidence** | Uses personal stories as proof over systematic evidence | "My grandfather smoked and lived to 95, so smoking isn't that harmful." |
| **Base Rate Fallacy** | Ignores base rates when making probability judgments | "Most infections are in vaccinated people" (when 90% of the population is vaccinated) |
| **Conjunction Fallacy** | Assumes specific conditions are more probable than general ones | Thinking "Linda is a bank teller and a feminist" is more likely than "Linda is a bank teller" |
| **Appeal to Ignorance** | Claims something is true because it hasn't been proven false (or vice versa) | "No one has disproven the existence of ghosts, so they must exist." |
| **Argument from Incredulity** | Rejects something because it's personally hard to understand or imagine | "I can't imagine how evolution could produce complex organs, so it can't be true." |
| **False Analogy** | Compares two things that differ in ways relevant to the conclusion | "Running a country is just like running a business." |

## Usage Notes

- **Multiple fallacies often co-occur.** A single argument can contain several fallacies. Identify the most significant ones. Ask user if further fallacies need to be identified.
- **Context matters.** Some rhetorical moves that look like fallacies can be legitimate in certain contexts (e.g., appealing to expert authority *within* their expertise is not fallacious).
- **Weak ≠ fallacious.** An argument can be rhetorically weak, poorly supported, or unconvincing without being formally fallacious.
- **Intent matters.** Fallacies used intentionally for satire, illustration, or rhetorical effect should be noted as such.
