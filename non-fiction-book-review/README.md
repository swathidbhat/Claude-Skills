# Book Review Skill

Most people finish a book, export their highlights, and ask AI to summarize. The highlights become an archive, not a memory. Understanding is outsourced to a file.

This skill flips the order. Before Claude touches your highlights, it interviews you. You reconstruct the book from memory. That struggle is where retention happens.

Claude then checks your recall against what you highlighted, flags gaps, and helps you articulate your experience. The summary is uniquely yours: your voice, your perspective, your takeaways.

**AI as a tool to enhance thinking, not a crutch to replace it.**
